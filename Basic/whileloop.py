## Sometimes we need to keep looping as long as some condition is True, and stop when it becomes False##
## We do this using while loop ##


# for i in range(10):
#     print(i)

# i = 0
# while i<10:
#     print(i)
#     i = i +1

# available_directions = ["North","South","East","West"]
# chossen_exit = " "
# while chossen_exit.capitalize() not in available_directions:
#     chossen_exit = input("Enter your direction").capitalize()
# print('you dont want to out')
